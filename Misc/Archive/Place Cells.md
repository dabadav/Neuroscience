Place cells are a type of neuron found in the hippocampus that are involved in spatial navigation and memory formation.} The firing of place cells is modulated by a variety of sensory inputs, including those related to rewards and memories (Lisman, 2017). This modulation can lead to the formation of output patterns that are unique to the current global experience. These findings have led to the development of the systems consolidation theory, which proposes that there are two memory systems in the brain (Squire \& Wixted, 2011). The first system is located in the hippocampus and is responsible for the initial acquisition and encoding of new memories. The second system is located in the cortex and is responsible for the long-term storage and retrieval of memories.
