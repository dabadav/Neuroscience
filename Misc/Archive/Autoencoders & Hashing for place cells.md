How information from sensory sources in compressed in the brain 

Optimizing neural networks that compress information recapitulates many observed phenomena
Spatially tuned activity emerges from dimensional reduction plus sparse and decorrelated activity.

What are the key elements to allocentric representation of space, spatially encode inputs: dim red, error back propagation, input reconstruction.

Place cells emerged out of grid cells and sensory that were already spatially tuned.

Hamming distance to compare images --> Clustering --> Rate maps from "Buckets"
