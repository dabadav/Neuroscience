A novel and updated version of this theory, the \textbf{Cascade memory model} \autocite{kaeferReplayDefaultMode2022} suggests that memory is a distributed process involving various brain regions, including the default mode network (DMN) and the hippocampus. The creation and ignition of replay of index codes involve a larger network, forming a hierarchical indexing system.  This hierarchical indexing system would be formed by this set of stages, with each level displaying spontaneous, autoassociative dynamics. This system would be capable of indexing representations stored on lower nodes (top-down) and also triggering reactivation of higher-level indices (bottom-up) to enable global retrieval. The Cascade memory model emphasizes the importance of criticality, which is a feature of cortical dynamics that allows for information to be transmitted across different levels of the brain's hierarchy. Criticality refers to a state in which neural activity is balanced between being too ordered (not allowing for flexibility) and too chaotic (not allowing for pattern recognition). In this state, the brain is highly responsive to changes in inputs and can easily reconfigure itself to store and retrieve memories.

The concept of \textbf{criticality has been used in neuroscience to describe the collective behavior of large-scale neural systems.}  This idea has gained popularity in neuroscience due to a growing body of computational research that has shown how neural networks can approach a critical state through various forms of plasticity (Levina et al., 2007). Moreover, criticality has been found to be an essential feature of cortical dynamics in particular. The cortex is a complex, multi-layered structure that is responsible for many higher-order cognitive functions, including memory, perception, and attention. The critical state of cortical dynamics allows the cortex to operate in a regime that is optimized for information processing and integration (Shew \& Plenz, 2013). Overall, the concept of criticality has provided a useful framework for understanding the collective behavior of large-scale neural systems and the fundamental properties of cortical dynamics.

Studying collective cortical dynamics is crucial to understanding how memories are stored and retrieved in the brain. Memories are not localized in one specific region but are distributed across multiple regions, with each region contributing specific aspects. These regions must work together in a coordinated manner, and criticality plays a vital role in allowing for efficient communication and information transfer across these regions. Understanding the collective cortical dynamics involved in memory processing, including criticality, can provide insight into the mechanisms underlying memory storage and retrieval in the brain.

According to this view, the \textbf{hippocampus generates a unique output code for each unique experience}, which is thought to \textbf{serve as an associative link to lower-level cortical assemblies} distributed widely throughout the brain. These cortical assemblies are thought to encode the various attributes of the experience, such as its visual, auditory, and olfactory features (Rolls \& Treves, 2011). This idea is based on a large body of research that has demonstrated the importance of the hippocampus in episodic memory formation and retrieval (Eichenbaum \& Cohen 2014). Studies have shown that damage to the hippocampus can result in severe memory deficits, particularly for new and recently acquired information. Moreover, studies using techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have shown that the hippocampus is highly active during the encoding and retrieval of episodic memories. Overall, the idea that the hippocampus generates a unique output code for each experience and that this code is linked to lower-level cortical assemblies provides a useful framework for understanding how the brain processes and stores information \autocite{kaeferReplayDefaultMode2022}. By identifying the distinct roles of different brain regions in memory processing, this framework has helped to shed light on the complex neural mechanisms underlying human cognition.

According to the \textbf{systems consolidation theory, memories are initially stored in a fragile state in the hippocampus}, where they are susceptible to disruption and interference. However, over time, these memories become more stable and are gradually transferred to the cortex, where they become more resistant to disruption and interference. This transfer process is thought to involve the gradual reorganization of neural connections in the cortex, as well as the strengthening of existing connections and the formation of new ones. Overall, the systems consolidation theory provides a useful framework for understanding how memories are acquired, stored, and retrieved in the brain. By identifying the distinct roles of the hippocampus and cortex in memory processing, this theory has helped to shed light on the complex neural mechanisms underlying human memory.

\textbf{Consolidation involves the maturation of cortical-cortical connectivity}, which gradually reduces the reliance on the hippocampus as memories become more established. As the cortical representations of the various attributes of a memory become more strongly connected, the hippocampal index becomes less important for retrieval. This idea is supported by a large body of research on memory consolidation and the role of the hippocampus in memory processing (Frankland \& Bontempi, 2005). Studies have shown that the hippocampus plays a critical role in the early stages of memory formation and retrieval, but that this role gradually decreases over time as memories become more established in the cortex. One way in which consolidation is thought to occur is through the process of reactivation, in which the neural patterns associated with a memory are replayed during sleep or periods of rest. This replay is thought to strengthen the connections between the various cortical representations of the memory's attributes, leading to a more stable and long-lasting memory trace (Rasch \& Born, 2013). Overall, the idea that consolidation involves the maturation of cortical-cortical connectivity and the gradual reduction of hippocampal involvement provides a useful framework for understanding how memories are processed and stored in the brain.
