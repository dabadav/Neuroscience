#### Low-Dimensional Spatiotemporal Dynamics Underlie Cortex-wide Neural Activity

Cognition arises from the dynamic flow of neural activity through the brain. To capture these dynamics, we used mesoscale calcium imaging to record neural activity across the dorsal cortex of awake mice ....

The brain is a complex, interconnected network of neurons. Neural activity flows through this network, carrying and transforming information to support behavior.

#### Single-trial neural dynamics are dominated by richly varied movements

Cognitive functions, such as perception, attention and decision-making, are often studied in the context of movements. This is because most cognitive processes will naturally lead to action: pondering where to go or with whom to interact both ultimately lead to movement. Laboratory studies of cognition therefore often rely on the careful quantification of instructed movements (for example, key press, saccade or spout lick) to track outcomes of cognitive computations. However, studying cognition in the context of movements leads to a well-known challenge: untangling neural activity that is specific to cognition from neural activity related to the instructed reporting movements.
