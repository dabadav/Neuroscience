Association areas in neocortex encode novel stimulus-outcome relationships, but the principles of their engagement during task learning remain elusive.

Using **chronic wide-field calcium imaging**, we reveal two phases of spatiotemporal refinement of layer 2/3 cortical activity in mice learning whisker-based texture discrimination in the dark

### INTRODUCTION

The neocortex dynamically changes when we learn new tasks.

What are the cortical processes—perhaps even before an animal gains expertise—that establish such enhanced stimulus discrimination?

*Higher-order areas*, e.g., retrosplenial cortex and secondary motor cortex, **mediate** learning-*induced cortical modulation via top-down effects* [4,12,13] but how spatiotemporal cortical dynamics reorganizes during learning of a specific task remains elusive.

Three relevant dimensions to be considered are:
- (1) the large-scale spatial dimension across multiple cortical areas, 
- (2) the time course of individual trials (lasting few seconds), and 
- (3) the learning time course spanning the entire training (hundreds of trials across several days).

With respect to spatial dimension, we previously measured large-scale cortical dynamics with wide-field calcium imaging in mice trained to discriminate two texture types with their whiskers in a go/no-go task.

The second dimension relates to the event sequence during individual trials. Whereas *most studies focus on the time period when the relevant, to-be-learned, stimulus is presented* [2–7,13], cortical dynamics before the stimulus is less well characterized. *Perhaps in some association areas, after a trial-start cue, enhanced and anticipatory activity develops just before a task-relevant stimulus arrives* [2].

Regarding the third dimension of learning progression, *most studies either only compare expert to naïve mice [1–3,5,13,25] (i.e. two time points)* or sample learning daily (i.e. [3–8] timepoints [4,6,7] ; but see [9,26]). Such low sampling frequency precludes resolving the trial-by-trial development of learning, which in some animals is rather rapid. For example, some cortical areas may display changes before learning takes place whereas other areas might change when task performance actually improves [9,10,26]

>[!Note] RESULTS
>We find learning-related cortical changes—especially in posterior association areas—that we divide into two phases: First, a pre-learning phase, showing suppression in several association areas, followed secondly by an enhancement of a specific task-related cortical activation sequence that emerges in parallel to increasing task proficiency.

### DISCUSSION

We have identified learning-related changes in cortical activity covering a wide range of spatiotemporal dimensions.

- Changes were distributed across many cortical areas and comprised suppression, enhancement, and sequential combinations thereof. 

- Salient changes occurred in early trial periods before texture-touch, indicating that understanding the trial structure and grasping the context, within which the relevant stimulus is embedded, is an essential part of learning. 

- Decreases in cortical activity occurred consistently several hundred trials before actual learning, suggesting that preparatory changes are required before subsequent cortical adaptations actually lead to improved task proficiency. The main pattern we observed is an early widespread suppression in association areas followed by an enhancement of a spatially more confined set of task-relevant areas.
