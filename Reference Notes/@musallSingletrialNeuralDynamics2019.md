When experts are immersed in a task, do their brains prioritize task-related activity? 

Most efforts to understand neural activity during well-learned tasks focus on cognitive computations and task-related movements.

### INTRODUCTION

Cognitive functions, such as perception, attention and decision-making, are often studied in the context of movements. 

This is because most cognitive processes will naturally lead to action: pondering where to go or with whom to interact both ultimately lead to movement. 

Laboratory studies of cognition therefore often rely on the careful quantification of instructed movements (for example, key press, saccade or spout lick) to track outcomes of cognitive computations. 

However, studying cognition in the context of movements leads to a well-known challenge: untangling neural activity that is specific to cognition from neural activity related to the instructed reporting movements.
