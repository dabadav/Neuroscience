**(1) Integration of computational modeling into the analysis of brain-activity data.** 
A key advantage of RSA is that computational models of brain information processing form an integrated component of data analysis and can be directly evaluated and compared. We demonstrate how to apply multivariate analysis to a set of dissimilarity matrices from brain regions and models in order to find out (1) which model best explains the representation in each brain region and (2) to what extent representations among regions and models resemble each other. We introduce a randomization test of representational relatedness and a bootstrap technique for obtaining error bars on estimates of the goodness of fit of different models.

**(2) Relating regions, subjects, species, and modalities of brain-activity measurement.** We discuss how RSA can be used to quantitatively relate:
• representations in _different regions_ of the same brain (“representational connectivity”),
• corresponding brain regions in _different subjects_ (“intersubject information”),
• corresponding brain regions in _different species_ (e.g., humans and monkeys),
• and _different modalities_ of brain-activity data (e.g., cell recordings and fMRI).

**(3) Relating brain and behavior.** We discuss how RSA can quantitatively relate brain-activity measurements to behavioral data. This possibility has already been demonstrated in previous work ([Aguirre et al., in preparation](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.06.004.2008/full#B2) ; [Kiani et al., 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.06.004.2008/full#B46) ; [Op de Beeck et al., 2001](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.06.004.2008/full#B64) ).

#### Step 4: Comparing Brain and Model Dissimilarity Matrices

Once the dissimilarity matrices of the brain representations (Figure [10](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.06.004.2008/full#F10) ) and those of theoretical models (Figure [6](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.06.004.2008/full#F6) ) have been specified they can be visually and quantitatively compared. One way to quantify the match between two dissimilarity matrices is by means of a correlation coefficient. We use 1-correlation as a measure of the dissimilarity between RDMs (Figure [8](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.06.004.2008/full#F8) )

We could use an alternative distance measure, such as the Euclidean distance, for comparing dissimilarity matrices. As for comparing activity patterns, we again prefer correlation distance, because it is invariant to differences in the mean and variability of the dissimilarities. For the models we use here, we do not wish to assume a linear match between dissimilarity matrices. We therefore use the Spearman rank correlation coefficient to compare them. In the Appendix, we present another argument for the use of rank-correlation distance (instead of the Pearson linear correlation distance or Euclidean distance) for comparing dissimilarity matrices. The argument is based on the observation that, in high-dimensional response spaces, a prominent component of the effect of activity-pattern noise on the dissimilarities can be accounted for by a monotonic transform.

#### Relating Models, Brain Regions, Subjects, Species, and Behavior

Systems neuroscience has struggled to quantitatively relate its three major branches of research: behavioral experimentation, brain-activity experimentation, and computational modeling. The RDM can serve as a hub that relates representations from a variety of sources in the three branches (Figure [3](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.06.004.2008/full#F3) ). We can use dissimilarity matrices to compare internal representations between two models or two brain regions in the same subject (representational connectivity, see below). In addition, RSA provides a solution to the fine-grained spatial-correspondency problem encountered when relating corresponding brain regions in different subjects of an fMRI experiment. Conventionally, different subjects in an fMRI experiment are related by transforming the data into a common spatial frame of reference, such as Talairach space ([Talairach and Tournoux, 1988](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.06.004.2008/full#B80) ) or cortical-surface space defined by cortex-based alignment ([Fischl et al., 1999](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.06.004.2008/full#B25) ; [Goebel and Singer, 1999](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.06.004.2008/full#B30) ; [Goebel et al., 2006](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.06.004.2008/full#B29) ). However, these available common spaces do not have sufficient precision to relate high-resolution fMRI voxels. Establishing spatial correspondency is not merely a technical challenge. It is a fundamental empirical question to what spatial precision intersubject correspondency even exists in different functional areas ([Kriegeskorte and Bandettini, 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.06.004.2008/full#B49) ). RSA offers an attractive way of abstracting from the spatial layout and even from the linear basis of the representation, allowing us to relate fine-grained activity patterns between subjects. Even different species and modalities of brain-activity data (e.g., single-cell recording and fMRI; [Kriegeskorte et al., in press](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.06.004.2008/full#B52) ) can be meaningfully related with RSA.

#### Data-Driven and Hypothesis-Driven Representational Similarity Analysis

RSA lends itself to a broad spectrum of analyses from data-driven (where results richly reflect the data) to hypothesis-driven (where results are strongly constrained by theoretical assumptions and the data serve to test predefined hypotheses). On the former end of the spectrum, the RDM itself richly reflects a given region’s representation. A multidimensional-scaling arrangement of the conditions set in 2D (Figures [1](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.06.004.2008/full#F1) and [4](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.06.004.2008/full#F4) ) provides a data-driven, exploratory visualization that can allow us to discover natural groupings within the representational space ([Edelman et al., 1998](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.06.004.2008/full#B21) ). But RSA becomes distinctly hypothesis-driven when we test whether a predefined model fits a brain region’s representation (Figure [8](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.06.004.2008/full#F8) ). One hallmark of hypothesis-driven analysis is complexity reduction. When we test a model fit by comparing two dissimilarity matrices, the voxel-by-time data matrix is reduced to a single fit parameter or the result of a statistical test.
