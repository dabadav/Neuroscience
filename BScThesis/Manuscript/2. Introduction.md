Memory is a critical cognitive function that enables individuals to acquire, store, and retrieve information. Without memory, learning would be impossible, and individuals would not be able to perform daily tasks or remember important events from the past. Memory plays a crucial role in various aspects of life, including communication, problem-solving, decision-making, and overall cognitive function.

Associative learning experiments provide insight into how the brain forms and retains memories. These experiments involve pairing two stimuli to create an association, such as a sound and a reward. By analyzing how the brain responds to these stimuli, researchers can gain insight into the neural mechanisms underlying memory formation and retention. For example, researchers can use techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) to examine the activity of different brain regions during associative learning tasks.

By studying associative learning experiments, researchers can identify the brain regions involved in memory formation and retention, as well as the neural processes that occur during these processes. This information can help us understand how different brain regions interact to consolidate memories and how we can intervene to treat memory-related disorders. Additionally, by studying associative learning experiments, researchers can gain insights into how individuals learn and retain information in real-world scenarios, such as language acquisition and skill development.

In Complementary Learning Systems Theory [[@mcclellandWhyThereAre1995]], the brain holds two specialized learning and memory systems, one in the hippocampus (which acquires new information rapidly) and the other in the neocortex (with a vastly larger storage capacity), which gradually merges the new information into the schematic knowledge base by some (yet to be clarified) gradient descent optimization algorithm.

An assumption is made that the hippocampus generates a unique output code for each unique experience and that these outputs are a direct, associative link to lower-level cortical assemblies distributed widely in the brain, which encode the experience's attributes.

The activity of place cells is also modulated by other immediate sensory inputs such as rewarding and memory, resulting in output patterns that are unique to the current global experience.

These findings lead to the formulation of systems consolidation theory which identifies two memory systems, one based in the hippocampus, which facilitates initial memory acquisition, and one in the cortex where long-term memory storage takes place [[@mcclellandWhyThereAre1995]],[[@squireRetrogradeAmnesiaMemory1995]], [[@squireMemoryHippocampusSynthesis1992]]

It is suggested that the memory consists of the linkage between the hippocampus output patterns and widely distributed cortical attribute representations.

According to this idea, consolidation entails the maturation of cortical-cortical connectivity, thereby reducing the importance of the hippocampal index [[@franklandOrganizationRecentRemote2005]],[[@moscovitchEpisodicMemoryHippocampus2016]]

Memory replay would be the driver of these plasticity processes, acting as a “teaching signal” of sorts for cortical plasticity.

Other brain areas, like the prefrontal cortex[[@eustonFastForwardPlaybackRecent2007]], [[@peyracheReplayRulelearningRelated2009]], retrosplenial cortex [[@changCoordinatedActivitiesRetrosplenial2020]], parietal cortex [[@wilberLaminarOrganizationEncoding2017]], visual cortex [[@jiCoordinatedMemoryReplay2007]], and auditory [[@rothschildCorticalHippocampalCortical2017]]cortex also have SWRs and these neocortical SWRs may be related to replay.

The prediction here is that it should be possible to predict, from activity patterns in one area, the state and activity of areas downstream from it on the principal gradient, including long-range correlations between downstream areas.

Replay in the absence of hippocampal top-down influence may reflect generative reprocessing of correlations at lower hierarchical levels of the cascade and/or older, more consolidated memories, whose traces are stronger and can be reactivated independently of the hippocampus. We are here suggesting that (representational complexity made equal) newer memories will require activations at higher levels in the principal gradient than lower-level ones (Fig. 3).

#### Cortical Dynamics
The concept of criticality has been borrowed from physics where it has been developed to identify the collective behavior of systems comprising a large number of entities 144. It can be understood as describing a regime balanced between complete disorder and perfect coherence among all the components 145. 

The hallmark of systems working at a critical point is the presence of long-range correlations between system components 146.

This description of system dynamics has gained traction in neuroscience thanks to a combination of computational results, showing how neural networks can approach a critical state through various forms of plasticity 149–151,

Moreover, reaching criticality is considered a desirable target for networks as it has been shown to maximize a number of properties considered favorable for neural computations such as responsiveness to external stimulation, information transmission and information storage 157–160.

• Collective cortical dynamics can provide a more comprehensive understanding of how different structures and systems in the brain work together during associative learning

.• The massive recurrence of cortical dynamics gives rise to highly complex dynamics whose function is poorly understood, and studying collective dynamics can help assign specific functions to these dynamics

.• Scale-free dynamics of both brain and behavior are important because each is associated with functional benefits to the organism, and studying collective cortical dynamics can help uncover these benefits
