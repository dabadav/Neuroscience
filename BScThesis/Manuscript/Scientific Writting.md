## BScThesis - Skeleton

### Introduction

**RELEVANCE**
- Cortico-hippocampal relevance on memory consolidation.
- Cascade Memory System as novel framework
	- Crucial point is the understanding mem cons focusing on **collective cortical dynamics** instead of individual nuclei.

**CONTEXT**
AIM

 Statistical methods -> collective modes -> behav corr.
DATA
- Auditory Trace Conditioning, using both neuroimaging. Difficulties of this type of data... Huge ... Multimodal...

**METHODS**
Experiment + Data + Preprocessing

Data Cleaning
- Component Analysis

Effects on Behaviour

- Whole-cortex + CA1 importance to capture global dynamics
- Cortex
- Hippocampus CA1
- VSDI Recording
- However no combined neuroimaging approach had been done before
- Setup limitations: hemodynamics, sample rate
- What is known about this two regions in this context and what information is lacking.
