The project aims to investigate the collective dynamic modes of cortical activity and their evolution during learning by using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. The project is interesting because it addresses fundamental questions about how the brain processes information and learns new skills, which could have important implications for the development of treatments for neurological disorders.

The research questions this project is trying to answer include:

1.  How does cortical activity change during learning?
2.  What are the collective dynamic modes of cortical activity, and how do they evolve during learning?
3.  How do higher-order interactions between cortical regions contribute to learning?

To answer these questions, the project proposes to test the hypothesis that there are distinct modes of cortical activity that correspond to different stages of learning, and that these modes evolve over time as learning progresses. 

This hypothesis is based on previous research that has shown that the brain's activity patterns change as we learn new skills, and that these changes can be captured by applying advanced machine learning techniques to large datasets.

To test this hypothesis, the project will use non-linear dimensionality reduction methods such as Autoencoders and Restricted Boltzmann Machines to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, making it easier to visualize and analyze. 

The project will also use sequential data modeling techniques such as Hidden Markov Models and Linear Dynamical Systems to investigate the collective dynamics and higher-order interactions between cortical regions.

These methods were chosen because they have been shown to be effective in analyzing large, complex datasets and can capture the temporal dynamics of neural activity. By applying these techniques to the extensive dataset collected by Rafael Pedrosa, the project aims to uncover new insights into how the brain processes information and learns new skills.

Overall, this project has the potential to make significant contributions to our understanding of the brain and its learning mechanisms, which could have important implications for developing new treatments for neurological disorders.
