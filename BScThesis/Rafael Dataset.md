This dataset we can find the collection of data from 6 mice subjects from the cortex and hippocampus.

Contains preprocessed 2 sessions per day and subject and the experiment was conducted during 15 days.

### Wide-Cortex data (VSDI)

1.  High-dimensional data: The video data consists of a large number of pixels, with each pixel capturing the activity of one or more neurons. This results in high-dimensional data that can be challenging to process and analyze.
   
2.  Spatiotemporal patterns: The neural activity data exhibits complex spatiotemporal patterns, reflecting the synchronized activity of neuronal populations across the cortex. These patterns can represent different brain states, cognitive processes, or responses to sensory stimuli.
   
3.  Noise and artifacts: Neural activity video data can be contaminated by various sources of noise and artifacts, such as motion artifacts, out-of-focus regions, or fluctuations in the imaging conditions. These factors can complicate the analysis and interpretation of the data.

5.  Non-stationary dynamics: The dynamics of neural activity in the cortex can be non-stationary, with changes in the patterns of activity occurring over time. This can be due to factors such as adaptation, learning, or changes in the cognitive state of the subject.

6.  Heterogeneous activity: Neurons in the cortex exhibit diverse activity patterns, and their responses can be influenced by various factors such as their location, connectivity, and functional properties. This heterogeneity can make it challenging to identify and extract relevant features from the data.

7.  Large data volume: Video data of whole cortex neural activity can result in large data volumes, particularly when capturing high-resolution images at high frame rates. This poses challenges in terms of data storage, processing, and analysis.
