**VSDI**

Voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) is a neuroimaging technique that uses a voltage-sensitive dye to visualize changes in membrane potential of large populations of neurons simultaneously.

The dye is applied to the surfac
e of the brain and excited with light of a specific wavelength, causing it to fluoresce. As neurons fire action potentials, there is a change in the electrical potential across their membranes, which alters the fluorescence of the dye. This change in fluorescence can be detected and used to create a map of neuronal activity across the brain surface.

VSDI has been used extensively in neuroscience research to study sensory processing, motor control, and cognitive function. For example, a study using VSDI found that in mice, odor information is represented in different patterns of activity across the olfactory bulb, providing insights into the neural basis of olfactory processing [1]. Another study used VSDI to investigate the neural correlates of attentional processing, demonstrating that attention enhances neural responses in visual cortex [2].
