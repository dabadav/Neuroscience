Collective cortical dynamics have been studied in the context of associative learning. For example, one study investigated how temporal context affects the learning of arbitrary visuo-motor associations

. Another study presented an alternative account of associative learning in the context of classical conditioning

. Rapid cortical plasticity induced by active associative learning has also been studied

. Additionally, contextual effects in sensorimotor adaptation have been found to adhere to traditional associative learning tasks that focus on the formation of associations between salient events and arbitrary stimuli that predict

. Finally, a study showed that neuronal responses in dHPC are relatively specific and encode properties such as position within an environment, elapsed time, and sensory cues during associative learning
