### 1. Preprocessing 
Start by preprocessing the neural activity data to remove noise, artifacts, and potential confounding factors (e.g., motion correction, denoising, or detrending).

### 2. Pattern extraction & Dimensionality reduction
Apply dimensionality reduction techniques to extract low-dimensional patterns that capture the main features of the data. And analyze the reduced data to identify meaningful patterns or features. 

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Identify the most significant directions of variation in the data and project the data onto these principal components. 

**Independent Component Analysis (ICA)**: Separate the data into statistically independent components, which may represent distinct sources of neural activity. c. t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE): Preserve local relationships between data points in the reduced representation, making it useful for visualizing high-dimensional data.

**Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)**: DMD is particularly effective for extracting spatiotemporal patterns from time series data, as it decomposes the data into a set of dynamic modes that evolve over time.

Clustering (e.g., K-means or hierarchical clustering) can help group similar patterns together.

### 4. Characterize patterns
Quantify the patterns by calculating relevant metrics or features (e.g., spatial extent, magnitude, or temporal dynamics). This step will provide a basis for comparing patterns before and after associative learning.absol

**Create a design matrix**: Construct a design matrix with the behavioral data (CS+, CS-, Reward onset, and Licking) as predictor variables. The design matrix should be aligned in time with the PC scores. It may be necessary to account for potential delays between the neural activity and the behavioral events (e.g., by incorporating time lags in the design matrix).
    
**Perform GLM analysis**: Fit a separate GLM for each PC score using the design matrix as the predictor variables. This will result in a set of regression coefficients (betas) for each predictor variable (CS+, CS-, Reward onset, and Licking) for each PC.

### 5. Associative learning analysis
Compare the patterns before and after associative learning to understand how learning affects neural activity. This can involve comparing the spatial distribution, strength, or temporal dynamics of the patterns. Statistical tests (e.g., t-test, ANOVA, or non-parametric tests) can be used to assess the significance of the observed changes.

**Quantify spatial pattern similarity**: For each PC, calculate a similarity metric (e.g., Pearson correlation, cosine similarity) between the spatial patterns of the PC across different subjects. This will provide a measure of how similar the spatial patterns are for each subject.

**Group-level analysis**: Perform a group-level statistical test on the similarity metrics calculated in step 1 to assess if the spatial patterns are consistently represented across subjects. For example, you can use a one-sample t-test to test whether the mean similarity metric is significantly greater than a predefined threshold (e.g., 0 for Pearson correlation or chance level for other similarity metrics).
    
**Analyze modulation during associative learning**: Divide the data into different stages of associative learning (e.g., early learning, mid-learning, late learning) and perform a separate GLM analysis for each stage. This will help you investigate how the modulation of the PCs by the conditioned auditory stimulus or reward changes across different stages of associative learning.

**Test for differences across learning stages**: Use a statistical test (e.g., repeated-measures ANOVA or a mixed-effects model) to assess whether the modulation of the PCs by the conditioned auditory stimulus or reward significantly changes across different stages of associative learning. You can perform post-hoc tests (e.g., paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction) to identify specific differences between learning stages.
    
**Visualization**: Create plots to visualize the spatial patterns, their similarity across subjects, and the modulation of the PCs during associative learning. This can help with interpreting the results and communicating your findings.

### 6. Functional connectivity analysis (optional)
Analyze the functional interactions between brain regions by calculating measures like correlation, coherence, or Granger causality. This can help reveal changes in network connectivity during associative learning.

### 7. Visualization
Create visualizations of the extracted patterns, their changes over time, and their associations with learning (e.g., using heatmaps, scatter plots, or network diagrams). 
This step can facilitate the interpretation of the results and the communication of your findings.
