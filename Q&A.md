**What are some definitions of memory?**
Memory is the manner in which content is presented to awareness during an act of retrieval.

Memory consists in an initial act of registration (learning) which, via the continuity assumed necessary and provided by the mechanism of storage,[3](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcs.1333#wcs1333-note-0004_7 "Link to note") eventuates in an act of retrieval.

Organically-based activity  in which information made available (via perception of the external world or introspection) results in an alteration of the neural machinery (i.e., encoding). These neural signatures are laid down (typically subject to considerable and ongoing modification[14](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcs.1333#wcs1333-bib-0014)-[19](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcs.1333#wcs1333-bib-0019)) in various cortical substrates (i.e., storage). To qualify as an _act_ of memory—as opposed to a _disposition_ to remember (i.e., the idea that a memory can both precede and outlast its expression; see Section _Memory Is Not Unconscious_)— these alterations must be causally linked to changes in the organism's behavior (mental and/or physical) at some point in time following their acquisition (i.e., retrieval).

Crowder[20](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcs.1333#wcs1333-bib-0020) defines memory as a term ‘used for both the product of learning and process of retention and retrieval’ (p. 4; see also Refs [21](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcs.1333#wcs1333-bib-0021)-[23](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcs.1333#wcs1333-bib-0023)). That this three-stage progression (encoding, storage, retrieval) captures memory's sequential logic is evidenced by its durability

Edridge-Green,[24](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcs.1333#wcs1333-bib-0024) for example, defines memory as ‘the process by means of which the external world and ideas are retained for use on future occasions’ (p. 1)

Von Feinaigle,[25](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcs.1333#wcs1333-bib-0025) taking a similar view, sees memory as ‘that faculty that enables us to treasure up, and preserve for future use, the knowledge we acquire’ (p. 1).



**What is episodic memory?**

Whether we remember an episode or not depends on a set of mental processes that occur during encoding of this episode, its consolidation and its subsequent retrieval. The capacity to encode, store and retrieve information of personally experienced events is called episodic memory (Tulving, 2016).


**What are collective cortical dynamics?**

Neurons operate within large networks, and to fully understand learning, we may need to understand how neural activity reorganizes at the population level. Recent studies have discovered tantalizing evidence of population-level mechanisms by considering the joint activity across many neurons[13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0095-3#ref-CR13 "Mazor, O. & Laurent, G.
