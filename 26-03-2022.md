### CONTEXT

Hierarchical processes underlying cognition

During learning we will first see an increasment in hippocampus activity

As memory gets consolidated we will see hippocampal independence

Low-dimensional set of distributed modes of activity can be identified in the cortex, explaining specific information processes.

### Research Questions

1.  How does cortical activity change during learning?
2.  What are the collective dynamic modes of cortical activity, and how do they evolve during learning?
3.  How do higher-order interactions between cortical regions contribute to learning?

To answer these questions, the project proposes to test the hypothesis that there are distinct modes of cortical activity that correspond to different stages of learning, and that these modes evolve over time as learning progresses.

### PROCEDURE

#### Dimensionality reduction

##### PCA
- High intepretability
- High spatial specificity

##### [[Dynamic Mode Decomposition]] (DMD)
- 



Are these patterns consistent across animals?
How are these patterns changing as learning proceeds?
