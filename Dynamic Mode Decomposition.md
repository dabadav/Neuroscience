**Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)** is a data-driven technique used to analyze the dynamic behavior of systems. 
- It is particularly effective in extracting coherent spatial-temporal patterns from time series data, such as fluid flows or video data. 
- DMD works by decomposing the data into a set of dynamic modes, each of which represents a spatial pattern that evolves over time with a specific frequency and growth rate. The technique provides a low-dimensional representation of the data that captures the essential dynamics of the system.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA), on the other hand, is a statistical method used to reduce the dimensionality of data while preserving the most significant variations. PCA identifies the orthogonal directions (principal components) in the data space along which the variance is maximized. 

The data can then be projected onto these principal components, effectively reducing the dimensionality while capturing the essential structure.

Advantages of DMD compared to PCA:

1.  DMD is explicitly designed for time-dependent data, making it more suitable for analyzing dynamic systems.
2.  DMD extracts modes that have both spatial and temporal information, allowing for a more complete understanding of the system's behavior.
3.  DMD can capture oscillatory and transient phenomena that may be difficult for PCA to identify.

Disadvantages of DMD compared to PCA:

1.  DMD relies on the assumption that the underlying dynamics of the system are linear or weakly nonlinear, which may not hold true for all cases.
2.  DMD may be more sensitive to noise and outliers compared to PCA, as it is based on the least-squares fit of the data.
3.  DMD can be more computationally expensive than PCA, particularly for large datasets.

In summary, the choice between DMD and PCA depends on the specific application and the nature of the data. If the primary interest lies in analyzing dynamic systems with time-dependent data, DMD may be more appropriate. If the goal is to identify the most significant directions of variation in a static dataset, PCA may be the better choice.


#### Assumptions

Linear dynamics: 

DMD assumes that the underlying dynamics of the system can be approximated by a linear time-invariant system. This means that the evolution of the system from one time step to another can be described using a linear operator. While this assumption works well for many systems, it may not hold true for highly nonlinear systems. In such cases, modifications like Extended DMD or Kernel DMD can be applied to capture nonlinear dynamics more accurately.

Low-rank dynamics: 

DMD assumes that the system's dynamics can be represented using a low-dimensional subspace. This is an essential assumption for the success of the method, as it allows for a meaningful low-dimensional representation of the data. If the underlying dynamics have a high intrinsic dimensionality, DMD may not effectively capture the full dynamics of the system.

Data sampling: 

DMD assumes that the data is regularly sampled in time, and the time interval between consecutive snapshots is uniform. This assumption is necessary to derive the dynamic modes that evolve with specific frequencies and growth rates. If the data is irregularly sampled or has missing values, the accuracy of the DMD analysis can be affected.

Noise and errors: 

DMD is based on the least-squares fit of the data, which means that it can be sensitive to noise and errors in the data. The presence of noise can lead to spurious modes or an overestimation of the growth rates of the modes. Techniques such as Total Least Squares DMD or noise-robust DMD can be employed to mitigate the effects of noise on the DMD results.

Finite data: 

DMD assumes that the data is a finite set of snapshots, which implies that the technique may not work as well for systems with very long or continuous data streams. In these cases, variations of DMD, such as Streaming DMD or Windowed DMD, can be used to efficiently process and analyze the data.
