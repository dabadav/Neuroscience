**- Clustering and Matching**
- PCA - ICA - Neural modes
- GLMs - PC relationship with stimuli
- Visualize patterns in response to behaviour
- Timecourse at behavioural onsets
- Boltzmann / Autoencoders to find neural modes (tensorflow, keras)

How many PCs are modulated by Reward, Lick, CS+, CS-, ...
What are the spatial patterns of this components
Distribution of this this number of components across sessions
Timecourses of activations around the behavioural data

Components modulated by reward, (2-3) individual timecourse. Exact same period plotted one against the other. Compare across sessions. VIdeo of PC fingerprint

Z-Score (time, x, y)
For each pixel timecourse mean and std - std
